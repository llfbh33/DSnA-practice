# DSnA-practice

Practice for Data and Algorithms

## Goals
    - Create a strong foundation in problem solving abilities
    - Continue to add new problems to review problems.  These will be problems that are solved then
        reviewed on a regular basis to keep up and improve proficiency and help to rewire thought
        processes to be able to handle more complex problems
    - Find new solves for review problems, find ways to improve on proven solves


## Problems to Work on
    Graphs:
        133. Clone Graph
        127. Word Ladder
        210. Course Schedule II
        207. Course Schedule
        542. 01 Matrix
        785. Is Graph Bipartite?
        815. Bus Routes
    Matrices:
        200. Number of Islands
        994. Rotting Oranges
        130. Surrounded Regions
        417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow
        1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze
    Binary Trees:
        102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
        107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II
        637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree
        515. Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row
        111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree


## Review Problems
    - 200 - Number of Islands
        - time complexity O( m * n ) - because it is all on m and n in the grid

    - 102 - Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
        - 10/1/24

        - 107 - Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II
            - 10/1/24

        - 637 - Average of Levels in Binary Tree
            - 10/1/24

    - 994 - Rotting Oranges
        - 10/1/24
